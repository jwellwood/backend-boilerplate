# backend-boilerplate

Node, Express and MongoDB boilerplate

## What is it?

A basic setup for a Node, express and mongoDB backend, which includes user authentication using json web tokens. Clone it, add your own details in a .env file in the root of the project and you're good to go.

- Add this to a .env file:
  PORT=port_number_here
  DATABASE=mongodb_connection_string_here
  SECRET=secret_password_here
